# FictionalUniversity


<h1> Introduction </h1>
<h2> For my Wordpress Customized theme project, I am creating a fictional university website that will have full mobility to log in as professor and for students to click like on posts. I will be using <strong>PHP/MySQL</strong> as well in the project. I have used PHP so far to add the header from the html files and the footer from the orginial html theme. I used <strong> JavaScript </strong> to add in a image slider at the bottom of the page. </h2>

<h2> I have also used PHP to add parent and child page links to the about us page and privacy page. One of the challenges I originally faced in the beginning is linking the pages together but once I learned the pattern I was able to add the similar idea to the rest of the pages.</h2>
<h2> I'm currently using the local by flywheel as my local server to work on my project. </h2>
