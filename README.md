# FictionalUniversity


<h1> Introduction </h1>
<h2> For my Wordpress Customized theme project, I am creating a fictional university website that will have full mobility to log in as professor and for students to clicl like on posts. I will be using <strong>PHP/MySQL</strong> as well in the project. I have used PHP so far to add the header from the html files and the footer from the orginial html theme. I used <strong> JavaScript </strong> to add in a image slider at the bottom of the page. </h2>
